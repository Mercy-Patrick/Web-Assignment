        <h2>Hyena</h2>
        <p>
          There are two species of hyenas in Kenya-the striped hyena and the
          spotted hyena. They can be found throughout Africa, in all habitats
          except rainforests. The spotted hyena (also called the laughing hyena)
          is the largest hyena species, with the females being larger than the
          males. Their coats are patterned with dark spots.
        </p>
        <p>
          These animals hunt fish, birds, and even hippo calves, and can work in
          packs to take down wildebeests or antelopes. Striped hyenas are lesser
          known than their spotted cousins. They are more scavengers than
          hunters and typically come out at night to feed on carcasses left by
          other animals. The spotted hyena is listed by the IUCN as least
          concern, and the striped hyena is near threatened. Human-wildlife
          conflict is the main threat to their survival.
