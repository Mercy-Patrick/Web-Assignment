        <h2>Dik Dik</h2>
        <p>
          The dik-dik is a type of dwarf antelope that lives in arid regions of
          East Africa. They can live in such barren environments because they
          get water from the vegetation they eat. They also take cover in
          undergrowth to protect themselves from predators, including eagles and
          cats.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are four species of dik-diks, but just two of them live in
          Kenya. These include Guenther's dik-dik and Kirk's dik-dik. Kirk's is
          the largest dik-dik, though it's still small in comparison to other
          antelopes. It stands at just 45 centimetres (18 inches) tall and
          weighs only 7.2 kilograms (15.8 pounds). Guenther's dik-dik is smaller
          but has a longer snout. The IUCN lists both Kirk's dik-dik and
          Guenther's dik-dik as least concern, though they are threatened by
          expanding agricultural settlements and excessive hunting in some
          areas.
