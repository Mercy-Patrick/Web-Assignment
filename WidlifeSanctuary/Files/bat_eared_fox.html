        <h2>Bat-Eared Fox</h2>
        <p>
          The bat-eared fox is another Kenyan animal that belongs to the dog
          family. Its large ears are its defining characteristic. It also feeds
          on insects like termites, lives alone or in small groups, and has six
          more teeth than other foxes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bat-eared fox can be found in savannahs, arid scrublands, and
          grassy plains. It lives in countries including Kenya, Tanzania, South
          Africa, Angola, and Zimbabwe. The IUCN lists the bat-eared fox as
          least concern and as having a stable population, though they are
          threatened by hunters, disease, and drought.
