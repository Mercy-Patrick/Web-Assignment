        <h2>Cheetah</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most recognizable animals in Kenya is the cheetah. These
          spotty cats with their own unique patterns are skilled hunters, in
          part because of their natural speed and agility. In fact, cheetahs are
          the fastest mammals on earth. They can accelerate from zero to 60
          miles per hour in just three seconds. Another interesting cheetah
          fact? Unlike lions, tigers, jaguars, and leopards, cheetahs can't
          roarâ€”they can only purr.
        </p>
        <p>
          These cats live and hunt in open grasslands across Africa. They can be
          found in countries including Kenya, Algeria, South Africa, and Niger.
          The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classes
          cheetahs as vulnerable. This means the species is at high risk of
          extinction in the wild. There are just 6,517 mature cheetahs left in
          the wild, and their population is decreasing. Cheetahs are at
          particular risk from habitat loss because they need such a large
          range. Most cheetahs live in unprotected areas where they come into
          conflict with farmers.
