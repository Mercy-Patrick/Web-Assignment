        <h2>Elephant</h2>
        <p>
          The African savanna elephant is the world's largest land mammal. It
          lives across many different habitats, including open savannahs,
          deserts, and forests. As these animals roam, they play an important
          role within their ecosystems. They disperse seeds through their dung,
          helping to fertilize the land; they clear paths through vegetation and
          overgrown bush, promoting plant diversity; and they use their tusks
          and feet to access water in dry riverbeds, creating small watering
          holes for other animals.
        </p>
        <p>
          African savanna elephants are found in 23 countries across Africa.
          They have large populations in Kenya, Botswana, Namibia, Tanzania,
          South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The IUCN classifies the African
          savanna elephant as endangered, meaning it is at a very high risk of
          extinction in the wild. Their numbers are decreasing because they are
          poached for their ivory, and their natural habitats are converted into
          agricultural land and infrastructure due to expanding human
          populations. The IFAW is working to protect African savanna elephants
          and conserve their remaining habitat through the Room to Roam
          initiative.
